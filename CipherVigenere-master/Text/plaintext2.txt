i had a great weekend. on friday afternoon, i finished work at five pm. i went home and took a shower. then i went to see a couple of my friends at a bar downtown. 

we had a couple of beers and a nice talk. 

tom told us about his new job, and jim told us about his new girlfriend. after a while, we went to a restaurant and had pizza. i went to bed late that night, but i was very happy.

on saturday morning i went running in the park. i ran five kilometers, and then came home.

after that, i met my girlfriend for lunch. we went to a thai restaurant near my house. i love thai food

i spent the evening with my girlfriend, watching tv on the sofa.

the next day, i got up and caught the train to my parents town. i usually go to see my parents on sundays, at least twice a month.

my mom usually makes a roast, and we go for a walk in the park or in the country after lunch.

this weekend was a bit different, though. my parents took me out for a nice lunch, because it was my birthday. after lunch, we took a walk -as usual- and then i caught the train back to london.

now it-s monday and i-m back at work, but i-ve got big plans for next weekend.
